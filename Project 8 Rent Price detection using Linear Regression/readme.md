Rent Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project focuses on predicting the rent price of a house based on various features such as size, area, number of bathrooms, and bedrooms using linear regression techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately estimates rental prices to assist both renters and landlords in making informed decisions.

Project Overview
The project follows the complete data science lifecycle, starting from understanding the problem to deploying a machine learning model for rent price prediction. Key stages of the project include:

Problem Statement: The objective is to predict house rent prices using linear regression based on relevant property features.

Data Collection: Gathering rental property data containing features like size, area, bathrooms, and bedrooms.

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting relevant features that impact rent prices.

Model Training: Building and training a linear regression model using the selected features.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using the

Conclusion and Next Steps
The project achieved a significant improvement in predictive accuracy by applying polynomial linear regression. However, further enhancements can be made:

Exploring Additional Features: Incorporate more features related to property location, amenities, or market trends to enhance model accuracy.

Trying Different Algorithms: Experiment with other regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to compare performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Continuously optimize model hyperparameters to achieve better results.

This project demonstrates the application of fundamental data science concepts and techniques in real-world rent price prediction, with potential for further refinement and exploration.
