# Churn Analysis Power BI Project

## Goal of Project
The goal of this project is to perform churn analysis on banking customers using Power BI. The objective is to identify factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Pivot
- Data cleaning and reformatting techniques

## Problems Encountered
- One of the challenges faced was dealing with a large number of values in attributes such as credit score, balance, and age. To address this issue, we grouped these values into ranges to simplify analysis.

## Findings and Further Scope
- **Female Majority in Churned Customers:** Our analysis revealed that female customers represent the majority of churned customers. Understanding their needs and preferences is crucial for developing targeted retention strategies.
- **Inactive Credit Card Users:** Surprisingly, many churned customers had access to a credit card but were inactive members. This emphasizes the importance of effectively engaging customers to prevent attrition.
- **Churn Rate by Age Range:** The age range of 50-60 witnessed the highest churn rate, indicating potential challenges in meeting the needs of this demographic group.
- **Impact of Credit Scores:** Customers with low credit scores, labeled as level 1 or 2, constitute the highest majority of churned customers. Improving service offerings for this segment can help mitigate churn risk.
- **Exceeding Churn Rate Target:** Overall, the churn rate stands at 20.4%, exceeding our target of 15%. This highlights the urgency of implementing proactive retention strategies.

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer churn behavior and lays the groundwork for developing targeted retention initiatives. Further exploration could involve implementing predictive modeling techniques to forecast churn and experimenting with personalized retention campaigns.
