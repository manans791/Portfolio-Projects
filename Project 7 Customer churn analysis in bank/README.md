# Customer Churn Analysis in Bank Using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a bank by identifying factors contributing to churn and providing recommendations for reducing churn rates. The analysis is conducted using Power BI for data visualization, DAX for KPI calculation, and various data cleaning techniques.

## Business Problem Definition
The objective is to identify factors contributing to customer churn in the bank. Key features considered are age, credit card holders, yearly income, gender, and customer activity.

## Data Gathering
Data was collected from internal bank databases, encompassing customer demographics, transaction history, and churn status.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Raw data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and missing values. Outliers were identified and addressed. Data was reformatted into categories for better readability.

## Data Analysis Techniques
Power BI was used for data visualization, creating insightful dashboards. DAX expressions were utilized to calculate KPIs such as churn rate and average credit range.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Less credit was found to be a factor contributing to higher churn rates.
- Churn rates increased with age, with the lowest churn observed in teenage years and the highest in the early to late 50s.
- More males were observed among churning customers compared to females.
- The overall churn rate of the dataset was calculated to be 20.4%, exceeding the desired 15%.

### Recommendations for Churn Reduction
To reduce churn:
- Target age groups with higher churn rates by implementing strategies to engage them more effectively.
- Focus on increasing the count of customers within the average credit range, as they represent a more stable group.
- Avoid targeting customers with excessively high credit, as they exhibit increased churn rates.

## Implementation Plan
Develop strategies to target specific age groups and credit ranges through tailored marketing campaigns and personalized services. Monitor the impact of these strategies on churn rates over time.

## Monitoring and Evaluation
Continuously monitor churn rates and customer demographics to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Adjust tactics as necessary based on ongoing evaluation.
